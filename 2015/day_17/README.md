## --- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---

#### Part 1 Problem:

> The elves bought too much eggnog again - `150` liters this time. To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.

#### For example, suppose you have containers of size `20`, `15`, `10`, `5`, and `5` liters. If you need to store `25` liters, there are four ways to do it:

> - `15` and `10`
> - `20` and `5` (the first `5`)
> - `20` and `5` (the second `5`)
> - `15`, `5`, and `5`

**Filling all containers entirely, how many different `combinations of containers` can exactly fit all `150` liters of eggnog?**
